This hosts file is a compilation of hosts that can be imported into various systesms such as linux, macos, pihole and windows.

If these items are added to a system level hosts file such as linux /etc/hosts it will serve as a secondary means of
blocking unwanted traffic should your primary dns blocker such as pihole stop functioning properly.

This list is intended to be a backup for blocking the worst offending url's that should never be allowed to be resolved.
